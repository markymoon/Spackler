# Spackler
Spackler is a Caddyshack themed Whack-A-Mole game... Let's do the same thing but with gophers. Bushwood Country Club is under seige and it's your job to stop the fuzzy invasion!

## Technologies
Only HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used.

## Game Objective
Click a “mole” as it appears. The amount of time each mole stays visible should be random. The game should have a time limit. There should be controls available to start, stop, and reset the game.

## Requirements
- The game should function consistently in IE11+ and one other major browser
- The game should function consistently in at least 2 unique viewport sizes

In the immortal words of Jean Paul Sartre, 'Au revoir, gopher'.
